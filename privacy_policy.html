      <p>
        Durham Calendar is a webpage to add your Durham University timetable to your calendar.
        We do not store any data from you, the user.
        However, if you use the Sign In with Google feature, we will get limited access to your Google account.
        Read more about how we use that access below.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>If I don't use Sign In with Google...</h2>
    <p>
      Then we don't have access to any data about you in any way.
      Easy peasy.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Durham Calendar is a web app that runs in your browser.
      That means that your data <b>never gets sent to us at all</b>, it stays in your browser.
      We don't analyse it, read it, use it for analytics, anything!
    </p>
    <h2>Reading your basic profile</h2>
    <p>
      All Google apps that change user data (like your calendar) are allowed access to your email address and basic
      profile.
      We do not use it at all, for anything.
      We would turn off access to it if we could, but it is not possible.
    </p>
    <h2>Calendar access</h2>
    <p>
      Obviously, to add your timetable to your calendar, we need access to your calendar.
      The permissions we ask for allow us to read and write to your calendars, but we only use the write feature.
      We create a new calendar to store your timetable, set notifications on it (if any) then
      we add the new events to it, and that's all we do.
      We need the read calendar feature to be able to write the events into your account properly.
